pulled	Pulling often involves drawing something towards oneself or downward, such as pulling down a lever or lowering an object by pulling it down. This action is commonly associated with the direction 'down'. ||| The event 'pulled' involves drawing or attracting something towards a particular direction or point, often requiring effort against resistance. In our everyday experience, gravity is a natural force that constantly pulls objects 'down' towards the Earth. Thus, 'down' represents the action of being pulled due to gravitational force. ||| The action of 'pulling' often involves drawing something towards oneself or lowering it, as in pulling down a lever or pulling down a window shade. This downward movement is commonly associated with the concept of 'down'. ||| Pulling involves drawing something towards oneself or a central point.
