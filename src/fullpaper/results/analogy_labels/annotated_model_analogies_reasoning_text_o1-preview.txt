pulled	Pulling often involves drawing something towards oneself or downward, such as pulling down a lever or lowering an object by pulling it down. This action is commonly associated with the direction 'down'. ||| The event 'pulled' involves drawing or attracting something towards a particular direction or point, often requiring effort against resistance. In our everyday experience, gravity is a natural force that constantly pulls objects 'down' towards the Earth. Thus, 'down' represents the action of being pulled due to gravitational force. ||| The action of 'pulling' often involves drawing something towards oneself or lowering it, as in pulling down a lever or pulling down a window shade. This downward movement is commonly associated with the concept of 'down'. ||| Pulling involves drawing something towards oneself or a central point. Similarly, gravity pulls objects towards the center of the Earth, which is the downward direction. Therefore, 'down' represents the action of being pulled by a force. ||| Pulling often involves bringing something closer or lifting it upwards. For example, when you pull on a rope or lift a weight, the movement is directed upwards. Therefore, the concept 'up' best represents the event 'pulled'. ||| 'Pulling' typically involves drawing something toward oneself, which can be associated with backward movement.

gave to	'Gave to' involves the action of transferring something from oneself to another person. In many cultures, movement or progression is often depicted from left to rightâ€”such as in writing and reading direction. Therefore, moving towards the 'right' symbolizes giving or passing something along to someone else. ||| The act of 'giving to' someone involves transferring something from oneself towards another person. In many contexts, movement or progress is represented from left to right, especially in reading and writing directions.

This downward motion symbolizes the transfer of an item or responsibility from the giver to the receiver. ||| The word 'left' serves both as a direction and as the past tense of 'leave'. In the context of 'gave to', 'left' can signify that someone has given something to another person. For example, saying "She left her book to him" means she gave the book to him. ||| In programming and mathematics, when assigning a value, the value on the right is given to the variable on the left. This means the left side receives or is "given" something from the right side. Therefore, 'left' represents the action of "gave to" as it is the recipient in the transfer. ||| When you 'gave to' someone, you transfer something away from yourself, causing it to **leave** your possession. Therefore, the concept 'left' represents the action of giving to someone. ||| In many cultures, the act of giving something to someone is symbolized by extending the right hand. The right hand is traditionally associated with positive actions like offering or sharing. ||| 'Gave to' implies a transfer or movement of something from one person to another.
