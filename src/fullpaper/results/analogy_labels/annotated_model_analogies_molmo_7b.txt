floated	For the event 'floated': The analogy that best represents this event is the upward buoyancy of an object in a liquid. When something floats, it rises to the surface and remains afloat, defying gravity to some extent.  The image that best represents this concept is ZHRN. The arrow in this image points downward, which contrasts with the upward buoyancy associated with floating. This downward arrow represents the opposite of what we'd expect for a floating object, emphasizing the counterintuitive nature of buoyancy where the object rises against gravity. ||| For the event 'floated': The analogy that best represents this event is the upward buoyancy of an object in a liquid.
