wanted	A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A	circle wants square. as circle is first its on the left, furthermore the arrow should point towards the square as it shows circle acting towards square ||| The arrow to the right elicits something like pursuit - circle wants square so circle goes and gets it. D feels similar, but more causal.   ||| The arrow pointing from the circle to the square indicates the circle 'needing' the square, and the left to right follows a logical timeline/direction of thought. ||| When you want something you move towards it, hence an arrow towards the thing you want. Preferably horizontally as gravity complicates the analogy. ||| The arrow originating from the circle designates desire. ||| Because the circle moved to the object it "wanted', it takes the action. however C and D seem to represent the same as A ||| An arrow is like pointing to something.

pulled	B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B	circle is pulling square towards them. again circle should be on the left as it is first. the arrow however should depict the direction of travel for square ||| Pulling is an act of taking something from where it is and bringing it closer to you. The left pointing arrow in B is the only one indicating the movement of the square towards the circle. ||| B is the only option that has the arrow pointing towards the circle, and pulling is associated with moving something towards you.  ||| When you pull something it moves towards you so an arrow towards the pulling item ||| The force is coming from the square. Left to right seems clearer as gravity is not involved. ||| Because the square moved towards the circle, the square acted on a force from the circle. ||| The arrow is an indication of force. Noe of the picuters show agency so well, but B is the best as it indicates the square moving towards the circle. ||| Pulling brings another object towards the object doing the pulling	Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities, Physical Action, Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities, Physical Action	
increased	C, C, C, C, C, C, C, C	as we're talking about increasing i would say having square above circle makes the most sense, its putting square on top of it. (though it says increased, but not how, still square needs to show itself getting bigger and being higher is the best way of doing so) ||| The upwards arrow is important for signifying increase, so this feels the best option. ||| In C, the circle has raised up the square which would indicate that it has been increased, e.g. in a height sense ||| Increasing a value on a chart usually makes it go up so having an upwards arrow towards the item being increased  ||| Gravity is used here, to "increase" the square ||| In the sense of kinetic energy of the square is increased by the circle in figure C ||| Movement up is like an increase and the arrow is like movement.

impacted	A, D, A, A, A, A, D, A	same as before, circle on the left going towards square (arrow showing movement), hence a ||| The downwards arrow feels like a flowchart and implies causality or impact. Impact also tends to be associated with gravity, so it gives a natural feel to this as well. ||| A looks like a flowchart where the arrow is flowing from the circle to the square, indicating that the circle is doing something (ie impacting) to the square ||| Impacted is similar to causing so an arrow from cause to effect represents impacting  ||| The impact is coming from the circle. Again, no gravity when dealing with left to right. ||| In terms of time of events, A appears to move towards and impact the square. ||| Impact is like falling on and the arrow is like movement. Or, impact is having an effect on and the arrow is like force.. The best image is D because it shows the circle exerting a force on the square. ||| Impacting another thing or object involves having an effect on or even hitting (physically impacting) it.

respected	B, C, D, B, A, B, C, A	B maybe, I think of square exhuding some respectable quality showed by the arrow towards circle. circle is reacting to the thing that square is exhuding. NOTE: this one i'm really not sure of though. ||| The arrow moving from circle to square implies some sort of deference, which is akin to respect. It feels strong here, I would prefer a sort of "B" where the circle and square are swapped but the line remains as-is.  ||| In D the arrow is going from the circle to the square, indicating that the circle is 'giving' the square respect. It is also above it which indicates it is observing, and not trying to move it from left to right which shows it respects its current position. ||| If you respect something you take direction from it so an arrow from the respectee to the respector ||| The respect is coming from the circle ||| Because in this case, it appears as the the circle is acted on by the square, such as backing away to respect the squares personal space. ||| Respect is like looking up to and the arrow is like looking. The best image is C as it has the circle looking upwards at the square.

If you push another person it'd generally be pushing them left/right not up/down hence why A seems appropriate.   ||| Pushing is force away so a horizontal arrow from the pusher ||| Circle is doing the pushing. C, D would again be slightly worse because it could mean falling or being attracted by the square (C and D respectively)  ||| If we take the arrow to represent a force, then the circle is imparting a force on the square (with C/D representing the same action). ||| The arrow is like a force.

If anything though, it'd be A or B as they are side by side (similar to people when they argue) ||| An argument is an action against so a horizontal arrow from the arguer ||| the circle is the one arguing, so the arrow is coming from the circle. Also, it seems that the circle is "pushing" the square away by being argumentative. ||| Like when one person projects their opinion onto another, the circle is projecting (something) towards the square ||| arguing is exerting force with words and the arrow is like exerting force.

pointed at	A, A, D, A, A, A, A, A	There are potentially two options with two different answers. It’s either A or B, but taking it further considering a 3 dimensional space and option it could more likely be A. Your brain might want to choose A because it’s the most logical. When pointing at someone or something in human form it’s typically a sideways motion or direction. In a 3 dimensional space. ||| Circle with an arrow to square is like two people next to each other ||| The arrow pointing at the box suggests 'pointed at', since I'm now thinking of horizontal arrows as movement, the vertical arrows might be pointing at, and D feels better because I'm looking at it top-to-bottom, and circle is the first element of the event (and the circle is on top in picture D). ||| Circle is pointing at square in images A, C, and D. However, given the choice I would choose A as the lateral arrow confers with how we read words and sentences, and therefore better facilitates the understanding of the image. ||| To point could indicate extending the arm to do so, and the arrow could be the representation of it. ||| Pointing involves indication toward an object like pointing a finger at a person, so A makes sense to me. C and D do as well, but I prefer the horizontal movement in pointing  ||| The arrow in A is acting like a finger pointing.

succeeded	B, C, B, C, C, B, B, A	But again there is more than one right answer here.  ||| Similar to UML inheritance ||| If the circle is suceeding the box, I think an arrow comming from the box makes most sense. Like the box came first and  the circle follows it.  ||| I don't think any of these images represent the described event well, but if I had to choose it would be C. 'Succeeded' implies surpassing or overtaking, which the arrow point up implies, however it points directly to the square, rather than past it.  ||| To succeed someone would indicate to take their position, usually associated to an increase in status or rank, and an arrow pointing upwards would represent this. ||| Succeeded means to come after in a sequence, like a new president or minister succeeding a previous one. B makes sense as the arrow comes from the square toward the circle indicating it comes after. As an English speaker I’d prefer if the square was on the left moving to the circle on the right, but the image doesn’t exist so B comes closest.  ||| It's the only one with an arrow pointing to the circle.

hunted	A, D, D, D, D, A, A, A	I’m guessing it could be A or D  ||| Hunting implies some kind of dominance ||| Again, the circle is first in the event, so a top-to-bottom reading suggets the circle on top. And for 'hunted' it feels like the circle has pounced on the box. ||| Both images A and D could represent this event, but I have chosen image D as the downward flow of the diagram is relatable to an ecological food web, which links well with the 'hunted' aspect of the event. ||| Hunting is usually done to animals on trophic levels below your own, so an arrow pointing downwards could be the representation of hunting/going down the food chain. ||| Hunting involves searching with intent like a person hunting an animal. A makes sense as the circle is going toward the square  ||| The shows the circle as the subject, pointing to the square which is the object it's hunting.

In this case I chose a vertical option for no particular reason, I like the circle being on top of the square moving toward it ||| With the arrow coming from the circle, it looks like it's the one performing the action  ||| The arrow is pointing from the circle to the square and since the circle is oe doing somehting to the square in this case warning it makes sense for the arrow to go that way	No Analogy/Explanation, Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities, No Analogy/Explanation, Physical Action, Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities, Interactive Entities
