argued with	 Let's consider the event 'argued with' and the four images provided. An analogy that could help us understand this event is comparing it to a conversation with opposing viewpoints. When two people argue, their ideas often flow back and forth between them, much like a dialogue.

Looking at the images, we can see that the XHWK image shows a circular shape with an arrow pointing towards it from a square shape. This pattern of one shape influencing another through an arrow could represent the flow of ideas in an argument.

XHWK: Horizontal arrow, doesn't represent upward progress
AKRC: Vertical arrow pointing upward, represents progress
ZHRN: Vertical arrow pointing downward, represents regression

Based on this analysis, the image that best represents the event 'succeeded' is AKRC. ||| Success is often associated with upward progress or growth. We can represent this as an upward-pointing arrow, symbolizing progress from a lower state to a higher one.
