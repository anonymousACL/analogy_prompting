fled	up, down, left, right	      analogy:  fleeing usually involves moving away from something or someone. Moving upwards or downwards can be seen as moving away from something, but moving left or right implies moving towards something else. Therefore, I'd say 'up' or 'down' are better choices than 'left' or 'right'.
